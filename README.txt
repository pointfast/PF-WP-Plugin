PointFast Website Tracking Plugin for WordPress.

== Description ==

PointFast Website Tracking Plugin lets WordPress users easily incorporate PointFast's website tracking code into their WordPress website.

Features
With this Plugin, users can gain insights from their email marketing campaigns, such as who specifically visited their website, which webpages were viewed and for how long.  Examples:
- Donald spent 82 seconds on the Pricing webpage on his iPhone in Washington DC.
- Hilary spent 23 seconds on the New Products webpage and then spent 117 seconds on the Features webpage on her desktop in NYC.  

These analytics help users improve their email campaigns to drive sales and engagement.  

Wait, there's more!  You can also track user engagement on the files you send via your Email Service Provider.  Examples:
- George spent a total of 3 minutes 33 seconds on the MLB Roster slides on his computer in Houston.
- Barack spent 74 seconds on page 8 of the Constitution PDF on his Android Phone in Chicago.
